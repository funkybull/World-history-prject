       <center> <p><font size="5">Ancient China is one of four ancient civilizations in the Neolithic era. Some of which were based near rivers, like the yellow river valley. The yellow river valley is The second largest river in the world and one of the more isolated river civilizations. But why would you want to live here and specifically why would you not want to live in the other three.</font>

     <center><header> <h1> SOCIAL STRUCTURE </h1> </header> </center>
     <center> <img src="./images/socialclass.jpg" alt="Yellow River Valley"> </center>
     <center><p><font size="5">The yellow rivers social structure is based off a Aristocracyrun social heiarchy, meaning that it was ruled mainly by the king and some by the upper class. Their was little to no conflicts in ancient china due to the unification of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties. So it would be a relativly safe place to live after the unification unlike some of the other civilizations.< </p></center>
    
<center><header><h1>Political</h1></header></center>
<center><img src="./images/wall.jpg" alt="wall"></center>
<center><p> <font size="5">the politcial aspects of this civilization is unlike the others. They had a decentralized administration meaning they would have a install loyal rulers into a city-state in the kingdom and have them rule it so the king doesn't have to rule over the micromanage the entire kingdom. The civilizations army was very powerful and large maintaining it with agricultral surplus from the lands the civilization had. The civilization also had something called a mandate of heaven which was a "link" from heaven and earth.

<header><h1>Interaction between humans and the environment</h1></header></center>
<center><img src="./images/climate.jpg" alt="climate"></center>
<center><p><font size="5">The environment of the yellow river valley was alsovery different from the other civilizations. The yellow river gets its name from the light brown soil coloring the water. The major difference between farming in Ancient China and the other civilizations is rainfall. Since there was alot more rainfall in this climate the people did not have to irrigate as much as they did in early Mesopotamia. The rivers flooding was also not as severe as other civilizations making it even a better place to grow crops.</font> </p></center>
<center><header><h1>Cultures</h1></header></center>
<center><img src="./images/heaven.jpg" alt="climate"></center>
<center><p><font size="5">Most civilizations had a simple monotheistic or polytheistic culture but ancient china didnt believe in that, they believed only that there was an afterlife. When a family member dies they move on to the after life to protect the surviving members of the bloodline only if they are properly respected after death. If not the surving family members are on their own. Besides religion their are other ways that the Yellow river valley varies from the other civilizations like the start of writing. Instead of writing beggining to help traders keep track of trades, it would help royalty keep track of important dates. 
</font></p></center>
<center><header><h1>Economics</h1></header></center>
<center><img src="./images/trade.jpg" alt="climate"></center>
<center><p><font size="5"> Economics was the arguably the most important part of any civilization including the yellow river valley. Like most other civilizations they used agricultural production as taxes. Building ships also had a big impact on trade back then. It increased the range of trade what they could trade. Some things they traded were Jade, Chariots and bronze items. All this later helped create the infamous silk road.
</font></p></center>
<Center><header><h1>Technology</h1></header></Center>
<center><img src="./images/chariots.jpg"</center>
<center><p><font size="5"> Technology is the only thing that would rival economics for the most important part of this civilization. A lot of inventions and innovations were created during this time. Naming a few are Iron metallurgy, Chariots and irrigation methods.  </font></p></center>
